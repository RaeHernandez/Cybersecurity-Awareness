Cybersecurity awareness materials created during internship with Tomorrow’s Leaders Today

# Cybersecurity Awareness Project – Tomorrow’s Leaders Today (TLT)

## Overview
This project was developed during my cybersecurity internship with **Tomorrow’s Leaders Today (TLT)**. Its purpose was to educate nonprofit staff and volunteers on cybersecurity best practices, highlight potential threats, and provide actionable guidance to protect sensitive information.

## Objectives
- Explain core cybersecurity concepts and their relevance in everyday life.
- Research and present real-world cybersecurity incidents affecting nonprofits.
- Create clear, actionable training materials for non-technical audiences.

## Key Contributions
- Defined cyber threats, attacks, and defense strategies.
- Highlighted the importance of cybersecurity for nonprofit organizations.
- Developed educational materials to help staff recognize and mitigate risks.
- Bridged the gap between technical cybersecurity concepts and practical implementation.

## Impact
- Strengthened TLT staff’s cybersecurity awareness.
- Provided a reusable framework for future nonprofit security education initiatives.

## Sample Content
> Cybersecurity is protecting computer systems, networks, and data from cyberattacks, which can come in forms such as viruses, phishing scams, or hacking. Monitoring and defending communications pathways, like Wi-Fi or internet connections, from intrusions is the backbone of network security.

> Nonprofit organizations are especially vulnerable due to limited budgets and sensitive data handling. For example, in 2021, Feeding South Dakota, a nonprofit food bank, was targeted by a ransomware attack, temporarily disabling operations and highlighting the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures.

## Technologies & Tools
- Research and report writing
- Presentation of findings
- Cybersecurity frameworks and best practices
